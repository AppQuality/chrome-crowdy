Chrome-crowdy is an extension that lets listens to all the clicks you do and prints them (and the error you get) in a file.

It's useful for debugging, if someone has to test your site and wants to pass you more information.

This extesion works on the following browsers:
- Chrome;
- Firefox.

The data chrome-crowdy tracks about the click is the following:
- url;
- timestamp;
- x and y position;
- clicked object id and class.

Furthermore, it also tracks the errors (some, maybe not all the ones that can appear), printing all the available information about them.

To use it, download it from the store (when it will be available), click on the browser action and click "Start recording". When you're done, click "Stop recording", and you can choose to print the .txt and .json files or not.

You can also use the "Show JSON details" to see the general format of the JSON that will be downloaded.

Enjoy!
